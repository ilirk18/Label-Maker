# Label Maker – CSS

Styles are split into three files (loaded in order from `index.html`):

- **base.css** – Body and main `.container` layout.
- **panels.css** – Left panel (controls, tree, inputs, buttons) and right panel (layers, properties).
- **canvas.css** – Canvas wrapper, zoom, and empty-state hint.

The original single file is **`style.css`** at project root (kept for reference; the app uses the `css/` files).
